### Welcome to my dotfiles! 

Finally I decided to upload my Arch config on some repo. This is my own personal collection of various dotfiles that i come across. It may not be all of my configs, but i will do my best to try share all of my work.

**Some of my tools:**

| Package                                                         | Type                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|

| [Zsh & oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)           | Shell with configuration manager                                 |

** Fonts and themes **

Because neofetch doesn't display my custom themes properly, there are screenshost of some of them.
